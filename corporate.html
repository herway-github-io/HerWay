          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
          <p>List of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>HerWay colour scheme</strong></li>
              <ul class="list-unstyled py-3">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #C40E5A;"></span>
                  #C40E5A
                  <p>Looking into our values, Empowerment is the most important for us. That is why we knew we would choose a vibrant and eye-catching red color. Red stands for power, courage, passion, activity and motivates people to take action. As HerWay is for women, by women, we decided to chose a bright magenta-red in order to make it more feminine. it is mainly used for headlines on the website.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FFAF35;"></span>
                  #FFAF35
                  <p>The color yellow is energetic, cheerful and creates a sense of optimism. It inspires thought and curiosity, which is exactly what we are aiming for with our great amount of various articles, educational videos and in-person workshops. Yellow represents new ideas and growth. It is mainly used for the buttons on the website.</p>
                </li>
				    <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #E8631F;"></span>
                  #E8631F
                  <p>The color orange fits into the yellow-magenta color scheme we already have, as the three create a sunset-like pattern. Sunsets and the golden hour sun rays are both tings people associate with road-trips and beautiful landscapes. Orange stands for enthusiasm, joy and warmth. It is mainly used for subheadings and buttons on the website.</p>
                </li>
				    <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #457F4B;"></span>
                  #457F4B
                  <p>Growth is the other essential value HerWay the brand has. The choice was clear, as the campervan lifestyle is about connecting with nature. Green stands for harmony, renewal and growth, it balances our emotions and gives a sense of safety. As we already have 3 vibrant colors, green is not a primal color and is mainly used for the images we uploaded on the website. This way it still creates a calm environment. </p>
                </li>
				    <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FFF3E1;"></span>
                  #FFF3E1
                  <p>The color beige was decided in order to compensate with the four different colors we have in our palette already. Beige stands for simplicity and comfort, which are both feelings we want to convey through our brand. It is mainly used for text over darker colored containers and as a fresh yet simple color for other containers on the website. </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            <li><strong>Font choices</strong></li>
			  <ul>
			  <li>The font used for most <strong>headlines</strong> is “Shrikhand”, which is flowing, rounded and smooth, yet very attention grabbing as it is bold and is often paired with the bright red color. This pairing is again related to our most important value, Empowerment. Flowing fonts are friendly and playful, very aesthetic and trendy now, which is in the center of attention of our target audience, young millennial women.</li>
			  <li>The font used for the <strong>body</strong> is the one given by the template called “Raleway”. It is a font our group has already took into consideration beforehand, as it is easy on the eyes and rounded similarly to the headings. Sans serif choice is better for a digital platform, where the body of the brand’s any text would be read.</li>
			  </ul>
            <li>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
            <li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>
            <li>All these elements must be justified by referring to the theory <strong>and/or vocabulary</strong> of design</li>
            <li>Please relate these elements to other units, for example:
              <ul>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>values and personality of the brand</strong>?</li>
				  <ul>
				  <li>Our website design fits the values and personality of ‘HerWay’ because the colours from our palette resonate with our values. For example, bold and vibrant colours like pink and orange radiate empowerment and give a feminine look. Green symbolizes growth and the neutral beige convey a sense of stability, safety, and independence. The highlighted motivational and inspiring quotes are meant as empowering call to actions to encourage women to charge of their own learning process.</li>
				  </ul>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>marketing and communication strategy</strong>?</li>
				  <ul>
				  <li>The website fits the communication and marketing plan by being an aesthetic entity in its own right. Most if not all of our posts on social media evolved around the fact that we wanted to capitalize on the aesthetic parts of the camper van lifestyle and the website captures that. The look and feel of the website is also very feminine which is reminiscent of our women based target group.</li>
				  </ul>
                <li>How does website design help showcase the <strong>unique value proposal of the product</strong>?</li>
				  <ul>
				  <li>Our value proposition focuses on empowerment of women. Therefore, we decided to focus on lively colours emphasising the femininity of our brand. The colours represent power, independence but also calmness that our target audience wants to achieve by travelling alone with a camper van and discovering the nature. 
Nonetheless, since our value is also about providing women with knowledge the design is also not too extravagant and it is kept in a simple, comforting way.</li>
				  </ul>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 id="production-2" class="mt-2">Credits</h4>
          <p>Please provide links and/or credits for third-party elements including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We only used codes and templates provided by the “Bootstrap” library and BUas (see <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/" target="_blank">getbootstrap.com/docs</a> for a list of such patterns)</li>

          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>HerWay is a community website where women can learn how to operate their campervans. It is a space where video and in-person workshops, tip and tricks, reviews and recommendations are all in one place that is easy to access for all. </p>
          <p>Our mission is to empower and support women as they embark on their journey of self-discovery. We strive to break down barriers, challenge stereotypes, and provide the tools and resources necessary for women to embrace the camper van lifestyle on their own terms. Through a commitment to empowerment, growth, independence, and safety, we aim to create a vibrant and inclusive space by women, for women, where females can thrive, explore, and create lasting memories on the open road.  </p>
			<p>The feelings we want our users to have:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>We want our audience to feel a sense of community with other women camper van users</li>
		    <li>We want our audience to feel confident and empowered in their ability to work their camper van independently and live within the camping lifestyle  </li>
			<li>We want our audience to feel a personal connection with the feel and voice of the brand  </li>
			<li>We want our audience to feel as though their knowledge and selves are growing as they continue alongside our brand </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The actions we want our users to do: </p>

			<li>Attend the workshops after learning about them from the workshop packages HerWay has to offer </li>
			<li>Watch educational videos made by HerWay </li>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Media Tactics</h4>
          <p>As stated above, we decided to utilize Instagram as our primary social media platform for promoting HerWay. This is because of the statistics we found that stated that it was the second most used social media platform by our target demographic (late millennial - early get z women). It also fits with the aesthetic image we want our brand to convey as well as offering us many diverse ways to post and interact with our audience.  </p>
			<p>On Instagram, our audience can find using the username @her____way. Using this account, we will be posting aesthetically pleasing images, reels and stories in order to promote our brand and increase brand awareness. These posts will consist of information about our brand and its upcoming launch to keep our audience informed, artistic quotes that match our brand values and aspirational visuals that will help curate the feel of the brand for our audience, and one on one content (interactive language like “which would you pick?” and videos of our actual team members.)  that will help our audience feel more connected and personally engaged with the content. On our stories we plan to repost our posts to have them pop up and be on our audiences’ radar one more time if they didn’t see the post in their feed. We’ll also be utilizing our stories to further our interactive and personalized content as this helps in building a stronger connection between the content creator and the audience. We want our followers to feel like they are being directly spoken to, so then they are more likely to engage with the content, comment, and share it with others (3 Reasons for Posting Personal Content on Business Social Media Accounts - Financial Resources Group Investment Services, 2023). We will accomplish this by posting things such as question boxes where our followers can leave their answers that we’ll share, “what kind of camper are you based on your zodiac sign?” and asking for user input and recommendations for things such as making a brand Spotify playlist, to make them feel as though they are part of the process. Finally, we want to utilize the Instagram reels feature to share videos of what our brand is about with members of our team so that our audience can feel like they are engaging with a real person rather than a faceless entity. This allows for a sense of trust and loyalty as they are more likely to trust the information shared and develop a stronger sense of loyalty towards our brand (3 Reasons for Posting Personal Content on Business Social Media Accounts - Financial Resources Group Investment Services, 2023).</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-33" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p><strong>What Worked and What Didn’t? </strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Good choice in target audience: Focusing on late millennials/early gen z’s was a smart move. Instagram, our primary social media platform thrives on visuals, high-quality images, videos, and stories. This resonates with our audience. We recognized this popularity in our own content.  </li>
			<li>Choice of content: We noticed that the video where we introduce ‘HerWay’ and the ‘photo-dump’ with aesthetically pleasing travel themed pictures were the posts with the most engagement.  </li>
			<li>According to our communication objectives, our goal was to gain 28 followers in three weeks. We exceeded this goal, and we are currently at a number of 96 followers. </li>
			<li>Our most liked post is a video which currently has a total of 45 likes and 465 views. </li>
			</ul>
		  <p><strong>What Went as Expected and What Didn’t?  </strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Expected: Steady growth in followers, engagement, and brand awareness. </li>
			<li>Reality: Slow start impacted our growth. However, consistent effort led to gradual improvement. </li>
			</ul>
		  <p><strong>What Would You Do Differently?  </strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Sole reliance on Instagram: We wanted to focus on building a brand image with aesthetic visuals which thrives best on Instagram. While Instagram is popular among this audience, it’s essential to consider other platforms too. Diversifying channels would enhance our reach. For example, Facebook is the most used social media platform for millennials. Although we didn’t use it as it didn’t match our wants for being an aesthetic and brand image, looking back, it would have been better to increase our reach in various platforms and add Facebook to our range of platforms. Being adaptable and participating in the trends our target groups follow would attract more followers.  </li>
			<li>Late/slow start: Additionally, we would have started the campaign sooner and started posting immediately and consistently. The brand image of ‘HerWay’ would have been stronger if we had posted consistently from the beginning. We were not as active as we should have been, especially in the first two weeks where we only posted 5 times. Early planning and execution would have given us a boost and been more successful in reaching our objectives.  </li>
				<li>Data-Driven Decisions: If we had analyzed our metrics consistently, we could have adapted strategies based on insights. For instance, the ‘photo-dump’ was most popular among our followers. Monitoring their engagement with this post would have been valuable for our interpretation. We knew that the success of the photo dump meant that it was desirable content for our target audience, but instead of creating another 'photo dump', we decided to veer towards making sure we had aesthetic content like the post had been. This was a big learning point. If we knew what it was that the followers attracted, we could have adjusted our content-calendar to prioritize similar content.  </li>
			</ul>
		  <p><strong>Reflect On Past Work and Describe What You Learned. </strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Overall, we learned that the marketing landscape is dynamic and changes rapidly. As a digital marketer you must be adaptable to trends and the engagement you receive. You also need patience. Building an audience takes time. Measuring your metrics along the way helps you grow and understand your audience better. The mistakes are also important to remember. The biggest mistake was not about something we did, but something we did not do. That was not posting early, consistently and solely on one platform. Involving cross-functional teams would have been valuable for our insights. Looking back, that is something we could have done differently. In the end it was a pleasant and valuable learning journey for us all, and we enjoyed making the content and celebrating our small wins along the way. </li>
			</ul>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>Our journey of building our campaign for ‘HerWay’ has been educating and challenging. Focusing on late millennials and early Gen Zs was a strategic move. Their preference for visual content aligned perfectly with Instagram’s aesthetic-based algorithm. We learned that storytelling in video and high-quality aesthetic posts resonated well with our audience and captured attention. In the future we will measure those metrics more precisely to adapt them in our content calendar.  </p>
          <p>Our initial growth was slower than anticipated. Consistent effort eventually paid off but grabbing attention early matters. While Instagram is powerful, diversifying across platforms (like Facebook and Tiktok) would enhance reach. Not diversifying puts ‘HerWay’ at risk of reduced reach, lost opportunities, limited analytics insights, and stagnant growth. (Edwards, z.d.) </p>
          <p>We also want to apply new marketing strategies in our future planning: </p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>User-generated content:</strong>User-generated content is something we will include in our future planning. We will encourage our loyal customers to create authentic (unsponsored) reviews in different forms of content. Think about photos or videos from our loyal customers on their stories and main feeds. It could be workshop reviews, travel stories or campervan transformations that were all inspired by ‘HerWay’. This will be extremely beneficial for our credibility and builds trust in our brand. (Shahid, 2023) </li>
			<li><strong>Influencer Collaborations:</strong> Influencer marketing offers several advantages when reaching out to millennial and Gen Z consumers. For ‘HerWay’ this means that we will invite influencers to join to our workshops and review them afterwards to post on their social media pages.  </li>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Why influencer marketing is beneficial:</strong>Collaborating with influencers produces impressive returns on investment. ‘’Marketers that work with both large and small influencers, 44% say that the biggest benefit of working with small influencers is that it is less expensive.’’ (Needle, 2024). Additionally, Trust and Impact: ‘’Gen Zers prioritize influencer recommendations over those from friends and family.’’ (Needle, 2024).  In essence, influencer marketing allows brands to share their story in a relatable, human way—a strategy that resonates deeply with our target group of young millennials/older generation Z.  </li>
				</ul>
			<li><strong>Community building:</strong>Community marketing will fuel the growth of our brand. To build a community within our brand we need to bring customers together over their shared interest in travelling. (Abe, 2022) We have already started building our community by posting stories with polls and quizzes. We will continue this by posting similar content, Behind-the-Scenes content and host live Q&A sessions.  </li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
			<p>Our journey building ‘HerWay’ was a valuable learning experience. We would have loved to continue building ‘HerWay’— one post, one follower, and one adventure at a time!</p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Before the interviews we didn’t really have much to say about problems that camper van users can encounter as none of our team members have such a lifestyle. We expected them to have some community building problems and that’s how our first problem, solution and unique value proposition came to be. We assumed it based on the lack of activity on all Facebook groups and different portals we looked through. We started with interviewing all the people we knew owned or rented a camper van without any specifications (no target audience).</li>
            <li>During the first few interviews we discovered that community is not really a big problem in this target group. On the other hand, when we asked our participants if they would travel alone we saw a big gender difference – women said they would be too sacred while men didn’t have a problem with it. That was the reason why we decided to shift our target audience to women already while conducting the problem interviews. After our problem interviews, we discovered that safety is not the only reason why women don’t really travel alone with a camper van. We heard from many interviews that their lack of practical knowledge and a very strict gender division while travelling with a male partner makes them very insecure about their skills and this causes a lot of stress – that they won’t be able to help themselves while travelling alone if something breaks or any dangerous situation happens. This is how the shift from community issued to safety and knowledge issued happened.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>At first, before conducting the problem interviews we wanted to address the problem of community because this seemed to be the issue. Later we saw that this is not the problem so also the solution changed. Therefore, one of the solutions was to create guides with ratings of the safest campsites for women. Afterwards, when we heard that a lot of women feel insecure about their knowledge – the perfect solution was to create online tutorials and physical workshops to boost their confidence together with their knowledge.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The first customer segments we had were very vague because we weren’t completely sure about our target audience. We discovered it mostly during the first round of interviews. Before the problem interviews, we only knew we are looking for camper van owners/renters. After and during the problem interviews we knew a lot more about the people we want to focus on. We added their interests, age, gender, location, concerns, goals etc.</li>
            <li>While conducting the problem interviews, we were identifying the target audience more and more precisely with each interview. That is why the interviewees are not very specific at this point. Moreover, it was really tough to find fitting participants, so we mostly based it on availability.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>At first our value proposition was focusing strictly on the community creation concern. It wasn’t formulated in a correct and engaging way. We rephrased it and focused more on empowerment and independence of women in regards to the second solution we found.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>At first, we didn’t really have any ideas for an unfair advantage. After finding the target audience it was clear that our biggest unfair advantage is creating a brand for women by women. This creates a big sense of trust and reliability since the target audience feels connected to the creators. Moreover, due to the safety regards the brand is authorised and has “authority” in checking safety of campsites. It shows that our ratings are reliable and shows the women using it that we actually have the sources to check the safety. On the 2nd canvas we also added one more unfair advantage that came up after adding the solution with physical workshops. The venues nowadays are quite expensive and therefore we are saving a lot of money by having partnerships with many venues all over the Netherlands. This provides us with more budget for the actual workshops and we have the advantage over the competitors.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Channels for our brand were quite straightforward because we don’t use many of them. The only ones that were there from the beginning were all placed either on the website itself or on Instagram. After finding the solution with physical workshops we added a direct and owned channel as physical events and workshops in the delivery phase.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Key metrics are quite similar for all companies promoting their websites on social media. Since we knew from the beginning that our product will be the website, we knew that number of clicks on the link to the website from Instagram bio will be an important metric to measure. It shows how many people actually go from Instagram to the actual product and how much does marketing influence them. Moreover, to check the engagement with the marketing campaign we decided to track likes, views and followers on our Instagram account.</li>
            <li>Those two metrics were there in the 1st version as well as the 2nd version of the canvas.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The only sure way of gaining revenue was adverting on our website. This was kept with the 1st and 2nd canvas.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
            <li>From the beginning our brand was supposed to focus on delivering value to customers.</li>
            <li>Nothing changed from the 1st to the 2nd canvas.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>State what your product and/or service is and how this contributes to your unique value proposition.</li>
            <li>Clarify the fit between the product/service developed and the brand identity/brand image.</li>

			<p class="custom-text-color fw-bold" style="font-size: 30px">Changes from version2 to version3</p>
			
          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>When we introduced our idea for the website to our second group of interviewees they gave us another two problems to reconsider. Besides being scared and insecure they also do not feel empowered and independent enough to try camping with a camper van alone. Moreover, they shared that there were a few times when they tried to get some answers to bothering them questions and they did get quite some criticism from men on the groups/portals they were active on.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>AAfter the second round of interviews, the first thing we discovered was that women also do not feel as comfortable on portals where men are present because they are afraid to humiliate themselves by asking obvious questions. Therefore, we decided that one of our solutions will be making our website strictly just for women and tailoring it to only their needs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The change from the 2nd to 3rd canvas was very slight – we only added a persona.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In the 3rd canvas the focus was put on mostly on creating a safe space for women to feel more empowered to travel alone by a camper van. The last value proposition was also formulated in an engaging way for the customers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our unfair advantage did not change from the 2nd to 3rd canvas.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our channels did not change from the 2nd to 3rd canvas.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>After broadening our solutions we could measure more things connected to our products themselves. We decided to add the amount of spots sold for our tutorials (nice this is the only paid product). Because of that we can check if our customers value our brand and products enough to pay for them. Moreover, we added time spent on the website and growth rate of engagement.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The revenue streams changed immediately when we added the physical paid tutorials. Then, we had advertising and tutorials as our revenues.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The cost structure still didn’t change on the 3rd canvas, only the actual costs and numbers were calculated. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>State what your product and/or service is and how this contributes to your unique value proposition.</li>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Problem 1:</strong> Women feel insecure about their skills and knowledge regarding camper van lifestyle. </li>
			<li>Current solution: They seek information online through various blogs, forums or videos. Nonetheless, most of the channels are taken by men what can make women a bit less motivated because they again see that it is a male-dominated environment.  
Moreover, a lot of women are active on social media platforms such as Facebook where they address a lot of their questions and concerns. It is a good way to do it, however even though the community is big the reaction rate to posts and stories is not very high. Moreover, there is thousands of platforms available but none of them summarise all the important knowledge in one place what makes it harder to look for specific answers. </li>
			<li> <strong>Problem 2:</strong> It is hard for females to make a decision to travel alone because they feel unsafe in the male-dominated environment.</li>
			<li>Current solution: Women usually do not make this decision. Most of the time they choose to travel with their partners or a group of friends. We asked multiple women to justify why wouldn’t they go to travel alone and the answers usually regarded safety concerns.  
The solution they can use is either to travel with someone or seek a lot of guidelines according to which some campsites are female-friendly and very safe. However, the guides are mostly created out of reviews what is never a fully reliable source.</li>
			<li> <strong>Problem 3:</strong> Women do not feel independent and empowered enough to try out this new hobby. </li>
			<li>Current solution: They try to crate online communities all around the world to make themselves feel more motivated and confident. Moreover, they follow influencers showing how this lifestyle feels from their perspective. Seeing other people can make them feel empowered and not alone.</li>  
		    <li> <strong>Problem 4:</strong> Women who decide to get more information on in various portals get a lot of criticism from men. </li>
			<li>Current solution: They seek acceptance on more friendly platforms or create their own women-only forums. This gives them the comfort to share their experiences and ask questions for which they could normally be criticised.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Creating an online platform just for women.</strong> 
An online platform created for women by women is something that can make them feel more appreciated, more comfortable and more understood. Products that are created by people similar to their target audiences are always perceived as more reliable and appealing.</li>
			<li><strong>Offering online tutorials, workshops, and resources specifically tailored to women.</strong> The tutorials and workshops are crated with the purpose of increasing the confidence of women, making them feel more empowered and teaching them independence so that they can fulfil their goals. Moreover, they are a safe space for females to get together, motivate each other and create a supportive community. </li>
			<li> <strong>Providing ratings of camping sites regarding safety. </strong> 
The camping ratings are provided not only from reviews but from actual visits of specialists at those campsites. The guides and ratings are supposed to be the most reliable form of checking if a campsite is safe for women travelling alone in all possible aspects. The aim of it is to decrease the safety concerns of women and make them feel more empowered and relaxed to go to unknown places.</li>

			<li>Occupation: Recent graduate</li>
			<li>City: Breda, Netherlands</li>
			<li>Emma is a 28 year old woman who just finished her master's studies in Breda. For most of her life Emma only worked part-time jobs as a barista, waitress or sales associate. She is very focused on her mental and physical wellbeing and loves spending time outside to connect with nature. She has a lot of friends around her; however, she is not in a relationship. Emma usually spends her free time working out, reading or cooking with her friends. She is outgoing but also appreciates her personal space and development.</li>
			<li>Emma’s goal is to break out of the typical lifestyle of going to a full-time job right after her studies. She wants to grow as a person both mentally and physically, empower herself to be more creative and independent. Emma wants to open herself up to new hobbies and people outside of her usual environment. </li>  
			<li>Due to her busy lifestyle and a long time spent studying, she decides to finally take some time for herself before entering a full-time workplace. Emma used to go camping with her parents when she was a kid. She remembers all the beautiful memories from those times and decides to go for a road trip for six weeks in summer, right after her graduation.</li>
			<li>Her biggest challenge in this is lack of confidence cause by multiple doubts in her abilities and knowledge. Emma is scared she doesn't know enough about the camper van lifestyle, measures she needs to take before travelling alone. Emma worries about her safety and security while traveling alone, particularly in unfamiliar locations. She seeks reliable guidance and support to mitigate risks.</li>
		    <li>She usually looks for information online, on various websites and social media like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube. </li>
			  </ul>
			<li><strong>Early Adopter:</strong> The perfect adopters for us are women who live in North Brabant (this is where the first tutorials will take place), are just starting their journey with camper vans or continuing it on their own. They lack the necessary skills to decide on solo travels and are willing to learn those skills online or by attending physical workshops. They are ready for growth and development of their mental and physical abilities and seek people to do it with. They have enough financial resources to invest in this growth and are planning to travel alone in the near future. They are open to receiving and giving feedback on our tutorials and website itself.</li>

          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Number of views, followers and likes on Instagram:  
It shows if the content of marketing is appealing to the audience. </li>
			<li>Number of website link clicks from Instagram bio:  
It shows if the marketing campaign on Instagram actually leads customers to decide to visit our website and try out our services. </li>
			<li>Number of sold tutorial spots:  
It shows if people are satisfied only with the online tutorials, or they want to dive in depth and use our physical workshops.  </li>
			<li>Time spent on the website:  
It shows if our target audience finds the content on the website clear and interesting enough to stay there longer. If they just open it and leave it can say that the website is too complicated or not appealing enough.</li>
			<li>Growth rate of engagement over time:  
It shows if the brand only stays with the customers gathered at the begging or if it grows in popularity over time.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our brand creates special paid workshop multiple times a year for our customers. This is one of the ways we gain revenue. </li>
			<li>Cost of one workshop for the customer - €60 </li>
			<li>Amount of participants at one workshop – 30</li>
			<li>Amount of workshops per year – 40 (approx. 3 per month)</li>
			<li>Revenue from workshops – €72.000</li>
			<li>Another way to gain revenue is through advertising. We allow other companies interested in our target audience (for a different purpose than ours) to advertise themselves on our website.</li>
            <li>We gain revenue through CPC (cost per click) from them. </li>
			<li>We expect the ad to have around 500 clicks per month with a CPC of €0.20 what gives the revenue of €100 per month. We are planning to allow around 4 advertisements to show on our website what gives us €400 per month and therefore €4.800 per year.  </li>
			<li>Revenue from adverting - €4.800 </li>

			<li> <strong>Website:</strong></li>
			<li>Web design (one time) – €6000 (fixed cost)</li>
			<li>Web maintenance (per year) – €800 (fixed cost) </li>
			<li>Web design can be a very complex and expensive thing but since our website is fairly easy and it is just a start-up we cannot have a big budget for it. Therefore, we will spend only 600 euros for the web design and development and 800 euros for the web maintenance.</li>

						<li> <strong>Marketing:</strong></li>
			<li>Generally - €6000 (fixed cost)</li>
			  <ul>
			  <li>Marketing of a start up should take between 7 and 9 percentage of the total cost. Therefore, 6000 euros is the estimate for us since our costs are around 70000 euros</li>
			  </ul>
			<li>Post boosting - €400 (variable cost – dependent on the number of clicks)</li>
			<li>We want to be engaged in social media and therefore post boosting and advertising is a big factor in our success. According to calculations below the budget for it can be around 400 euros.</li>
			<li>€6 per 1000 clicks</li>
			<li>5 boosted posts per month = 60 posts per year</li>
			<li>1000 clicks per post = 360 euros per year for Instagram = estimate to 400 </li>

			<li>Video creation = €300 per 1 minute video</li>

          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In the interviews we conducted with our target audience we heard a lot about various problems women can encounter as female camper van users, such as: safety concerns connected to the environment being dominated by men but also connected to lack of technical knowledge. Women felt very uncomfortable travelling alone due to insecurities connected to vehicle maintenance, technical issues and concerns about safety of campsites.</li>
            <li>HerWay solves those problems in multiple ways providing the target audience with various solutions tailored to their needs. The products/services we provide as solutions include:</li>
			 <ul>
			  <li>Online video tutorials on various subjects such as: Van makeover, Tips and Tricks, DIY </li>
			  <li>Physical workshops on topics of: safety, technical issues, vehicle maintenance or self defense</li>
			  <li>Articles with rankings of camping sites regarding safety for women</li>
			  </ul>
			<li>Our value proposition talks mostly about empowerment of women to travel alone with a camper van. However, the first step to be empowered is to feel confident and secure. With our products we aim to provide our audience with those feelings and place them on the right path to reach full empowerment at the end. By providing women with those tutorials and workshops we want to make them feel more comfortable in their skills and knowledge what will allow them to travel alone in a more comfortable and confident way.  </li>
			<li>All of our products/services are placed or accessible through our website. Since our vision is focused on creating a perfect sanctuary for women willing to grow their mental and physical skills it connects perfectly to the idea of a website as the sanctuary. The website is a great representation what our brand stands for.  </li>
          </ul>
			
		
          <p class="fw-bold">Justification problem interviews</p>
          <ul>
			 <li>We got many insights from our problem interviews. We initially focused on community building as a primary issue whilethe real challenges for women travelers focused on safety, knowledge gaps, and a lack of empowerment. This was crucial in reshaping our whole brand idea and identity since it completely changed all the problems and solutions. Without the interviews we would still be focusing only on the community problem that came out to be non-existent. Our value proposition was also completely changed after those discoveries.  Even though we got a lot of different problems, we had to focus only on some of them to make our brand as tailored to our target audience as possible.</li>
			</ul>

          <h4 id="management-4" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>The first lean canvas was made completely on our assumptions. We didn’t have any ideas on who to choose for our customer segments and therefore, we chose to target all the camper van users we can access without any specifications. This shifted very quickly after a few of the first problem interviews and then we decided to focus strictly on female millennials seeking guidance on starting their solo travelling journey with a camper van. It was caused by the most insights in this topic during the interviews with both men and women.</p>
	      <p>The same happened with our assumed problem about community. We thought that building and keeping the community within the camper van environment would be hard. This assumption was made based on researching the Facebook groups and lack of activity on most of them. We saw a lot of people writing posts but not so many replying to them. However, from all participants asked about this issue only one confirmed it, the rest didn’t find it a problem. Therefore, we switched our focus to other problems that our more specified customer segment struggled with.</p>
	      <p>Together with changing the problem we obviously were required to change the solutions and therefore our value proposition. The first value proposition stated that we want to create a community, the second one included only empowerment of women and the third one put the way to reach this empowerment as well what is crucial for our brand. Without specific resources, one will never be able to reach the final goal of independence and empowerment.  
Therefore, it can be concluded that most of our initial assumptions were wrong and the interviews provided us with a lot of valuable insights enabling us to create a better brand and product.</p>
