          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Before the interviews we didn’t really have much to say about problems that camper van users can encounter as none of our team members have such a lifestyle. We expected them to have some community building problems and that’s how our first problem, solution and unique value proposition came to be. We assumed it based on the lack of activity on all Facebook groups and different portals we looked through. We started with interviewing all the people we knew owned or rented a camper van without any specifications (no target audience).</li>
            <li>During the first few interviews we discovered that community is not really a big problem in this target group. On the other hand, when we asked our participants if they would travel alone we saw a big gender difference – women said they would be too sacred while men didn’t have a problem with it. That was the reason why we decided to shift our target audience to women already while conducting the problem interviews. After our problem interviews, we discovered that safety is not the only reason why women don’t really travel alone with a camper van. We heard from many interviews that their lack of practical knowledge and a very strict gender division while travelling with a male partner makes them very insecure about their skills and this causes a lot of stress – that they won’t be able to help themselves while travelling alone if something breaks or any dangerous situation happens. This is how the shift from community issued to safety and knowledge issued happened.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>At first, before conducting the problem interviews we wanted to address the problem of community because this seemed to be the issue. Later we saw that this is not the problem so also the solution changed. Therefore, one of the solutions was to create guides with ratings of the safest campsites for women. Afterwards, when we heard that a lot of women feel insecure about their knowledge – the perfect solution was to create online tutorials and physical workshops to boost their confidence together with their knowledge.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The first customer segments we had were very vague because we weren’t completely sure about our target audience. We discovered it mostly during the first round of interviews. Before the problem interviews, we only knew we are looking for camper van owners/renters. After and during the problem interviews we knew a lot more about the people we want to focus on. We added their interests, age, gender, location, concerns, goals etc.</li>
            <li>While conducting the problem interviews, we were identifying the target audience more and more precisely with each interview. That is why the interviewees are not very specific at this point. Moreover, it was really tough to find fitting participants, so we mostly based it on availability.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>At first our value proposition was focusing strictly on the community creation concern. It wasn’t formulated in a correct and engaging way. We rephrased it and focused more on empowerment and independence of women in regards to the second solution we found.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>At first, we didn’t really have any ideas for an unfair advantage. After finding the target audience it was clear that our biggest unfair advantage is creating a brand for women by women. This creates a big sense of trust and reliability since the target audience feels connected to the creators. Moreover, due to the safety regards the brand is authorised and has “authority” in checking safety of campsites. It shows that our ratings are reliable and shows the women using it that we actually have the sources to check the safety. On the 2nd canvas we also added one more unfair advantage that came up after adding the solution with physical workshops. The venues nowadays are quite expensive and therefore we are saving a lot of money by having partnerships with many venues all over the Netherlands. This provides us with more budget for the actual workshops and we have the advantage over the competitors.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Channels for our brand were quite straightforward because we don’t use many of them. The only ones that were there from the beginning were all placed either on the website itself or on Instagram. After finding the solution with physical workshops we added a direct and owned channel as physical events and workshops in the delivery phase.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Key metrics are quite similar for all companies promoting their websites on social media. Since we knew from the beginning that our product will be the website, we knew that number of clicks on the link to the website from Instagram bio will be an important metric to measure. It shows how many people actually go from Instagram to the actual product and how much does marketing influence them. Moreover, to check the engagement with the marketing campaign we decided to track likes, views and followers on our Instagram account.</li>
            <li>Those two metrics were there in the 1st version as well as the 2nd version of the canvas.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The only sure way of gaining revenue was adverting on our website. This was kept with the 1st and 2nd canvas.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
            <li>From the beginning our brand was supposed to focus on delivering value to customers.</li>
            <li>Nothing changed from the 1st to the 2nd canvas.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>State what your product and/or service is and how this contributes to your unique value proposition.</li>
            <li>Clarify the fit between the product/service developed and the brand identity/brand image.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>When we introduced our idea for the website to our second group of interviewees they gave us another two problems to reconsider. Besides being scared and insecure they also do not feel empowered and independent enough to try camping with a camper van alone. Moreover, they shared that there were a few times when they tried to get some answers to bothering them questions and they did get quite some criticism from men on the groups/portals they were active on.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>AAfter the second round of interviews, the first thing we discovered was that women also do not feel as comfortable on portals where men are present because they are afraid to humiliate themselves by asking obvious questions. Therefore, we decided that one of our solutions will be making our website strictly just for women and tailoring it to only their needs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The change from the 2nd to 3rd canvas was very slight – we only added a persona.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In the 3rd canvas the focus was put on mostly on creating a safe space for women to feel more empowered to travel alone by a camper van. The last value proposition was also formulated in an engaging way for the customers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our unfair advantage did not change from the 2nd to 3rd canvas.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our channels did not change from the 2nd to 3rd canvas.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>After broadening our solutions we could measure more things connected to our products themselves. We decided to add the amount of spots sold for our tutorials (nice this is the only paid product). Because of that we can check if our customers value our brand and products enough to pay for them. Moreover, we added time spent on the website and growth rate of engagement.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The revenue streams changed immediately when we added the physical paid tutorials. Then, we had advertising and tutorials as our revenues.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The cost structure still didn’t change on the 3rd canvas, only the actual costs and numbers were calculated. </li>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Problem 1:</strong> Women feel insecure about their skills and knowledge regarding camper van lifestyle. </li>
			<li>Current solution: They seek information online through various blogs, forums or videos. Nonetheless, most of the channels are taken by men what can make women a bit less motivated because they again see that it is a male-dominated environment.  
Moreover, a lot of women are active on social media platforms such as Facebook where they address a lot of their questions and concerns. It is a good way to do it, however even though the community is big the reaction rate to posts and stories is not very high. Moreover, there is thousands of platforms available but none of them summarise all the important knowledge in one place what makes it harder to look for specific answers. </li>
			<li> <strong>Problem 2:</strong> It is hard for females to make a decision to travel alone because they feel unsafe in the male-dominated environment.</li>
			<li>Current solution: Women usually do not make this decision. Most of the time they choose to travel with their partners or a group of friends. We asked multiple women to justify why wouldn’t they go to travel alone and the answers usually regarded safety concerns.  
The solution they can use is either to travel with someone or seek a lot of guidelines according to which some campsites are female-friendly and very safe. However, the guides are mostly created out of reviews what is never a fully reliable source.</li>
			<li> <strong>Problem 3:</strong> Women do not feel independent and empowered enough to try out this new hobby. </li>
			<li>Current solution: They try to crate online communities all around the world to make themselves feel more motivated and confident. Moreover, they follow influencers showing how this lifestyle feels from their perspective. Seeing other people can make them feel empowered and not alone.</li>  
		    <li> <strong>Problem 4:</strong> Women who decide to get more information on in various portals get a lot of criticism from men. </li>
			<li>Current solution: They seek acceptance on more friendly platforms or create their own women-only forums. This gives them the comfort to share their experiences and ask questions for which they could normally be criticised.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Creating an online platform just for women.</strong> 
An online platform created for women by women is something that can make them feel more appreciated, more comfortable and more understood. Products that are created by people similar to their target audiences are always perceived as more reliable and appealing.</li>
			<li><strong>Offering online tutorials, workshops, and resources specifically tailored to women.</strong> The tutorials and workshops are crated with the purpose of increasing the confidence of women, making them feel more empowered and teaching them independence so that they can fulfil their goals. Moreover, they are a safe space for females to get together, motivate each other and create a supportive community. </li>
			<li> <strong>Providing ratings of camping sites regarding safety. </strong> 
The camping ratings are provided not only from reviews but from actual visits of specialists at those campsites. The guides and ratings are supposed to be the most reliable form of checking if a campsite is safe for women travelling alone in all possible aspects. The aim of it is to decrease the safety concerns of women and make them feel more empowered and relaxed to go to unknown places.</li>
